# Build on Autheo (Draft)

## Why Build on Autheo?

### Next Generation Layer-1 Technology

Autheo allows you to create a bespoke blockchain solution that doesn’t introduce new problems. Designed with creators in mind, the Autheo blockchain supports a wide range of developer tools on a robust cloud-first infrastructure. Decentralized by nature, our Web3 platform leverages fast transaction speeds and EVM compatibility to build next generation dApps with performance that meets or exceeds their Web2 competitors.

### A Flexible Blockchain That Grows with You

Use your favorite tools on the premier blockchain for content creators. Our fully modular protocol supports all EVM-compatible SDKs and developer tools, allowing new developers to onboard quickly and comfortably in a fully scalable environment.

There’s no need to start from scratch when you start with Autheo. You can build using Solidity, the Cosmos SDK, or even Layer-2 solutions like ZK Sync and Arbitrum to launch your project on Autheo without changing a single line of code. 

### Not Just a Blockchain

When you join Autheo, you aren’t simply building on a Layer-1 blockchain. You’re joining a wide-ranging network of creators and creatives in an advanced SocialFi ecosystem. Our fully realized social platform integrates seamlessly with the Autheo blockchain to provide the best of both worlds.

From new tools on our Developer Hub to integrated Layer-2 solutions, Autheo provides a full-stack experience both on and off the blockchain.

## Key Developer Advantages

### Swap Platforms Without Swapping Code

Autheo’s blockchain infrastructure natively supports a wide variety of SDKs and developer tools. If you’ve built on an EVM compatible platform in the past, you can easily port over to Autheo without changing a single line of code. As a best-in-class Layer-1 blockchain, we believe that onboarding your development team should be quick and easy. This way, you can spend more time building your project and less time worrying about a proprietary language.

### Built at the Speed of Business

We believe that Web3 projects should move at Web2 speeds. Autheo’s fast finality, high transactions per second and securely decentralized infrastructure allow you to enjoy the best of both worlds – the speed of traditional web-based products with the added security and flexibility of blockchain technology. You can build with confidence knowing that Autheo can handle any level of demand.

### Adapt and Overcome

Our modular-by-nature design ensures that you can leverage any number of consensus mechanisms and developer tools. Integrating with most major blockchain platforms, Autheo allows developers to effectively plug-and-play from a wide variety of pre-made and extensively tested features from across the greater Web3 ecosystem.

## Compelling Opportunity in the Creator Economy

### A 21st Century Market

As one of the fastest growing global markets, creators represent a driving force in platform innovation. Currently, over two million creators earn more than $100,000 USD annually – with that number projected to grow to five million by 2027. Autheo’s SocialFi platform provides these creators with an all-encompassing toolkit, integrating features from all major content platforms into one seamless experience.

### Built with the Creator in Mind

Where legacy content platforms subject their creators to opaque algorithms and shifting revenue models, Autheo provides full ownership to our creators. Creators building on Autheo have access to a wide range of tools specifically catered to their needs and the ability to directly monetize their audience without costly intermediaries.

### Find Your Community

Our modular platform provides numerous building blocks to create networks at all levels of granularity. From the widest appeal to the smallest niche, find your community of creators and discover new talent through Autheo’s creator-focused infrastructure. We recognize that many domains are underserved by current platforms, and we built our ecosystem to empower these niche creators.

## Ecosystem Integration Opportunities

### Collaborate and Integrate

Projects built on Autheo can naturally integrate with the Creator SocialFi ecosystem, providing developers and creators with an easy means to cross-collaborate on large projects. Autheo-native applications are instantly compatible with existing audiences and a wide array of creator networks in every niche. Through a simple, seamless hub developers can reach out to creators and vice versa, inspiring innovation through communication. 

### Introducing the Developer Hub

The Developer Hub offers a place for developers to sync directly with creators, offering their applications with direct monetization. Developers can build and launch their application directly into the Autheo marketplace and see immediate, recurring revenue. Rather than grappling with multiple platforms and payment solutions, we built Autheo from the ground up to make life easier for developers and their creator clients.

## Developer Toolkits and SDKs

### Cross-Chain Compatibility

When you build on Autheo, your project will be inherently compatible with most major blockchains. Without changing a single line of code, you can launch your application across multiple chains and build a wide network that appeals to a variety of users. Autheo supports many leading SDKs, including Cosmus, Ethereum and a variety of Layer-2 Rollups.

### Build, Launch, Profit

Rapid iteration and a fast time-to-market are key for successful Web3 applications. With that in mind, Autheo’s infrastructure and available APIs enable your project to launch and start making money in the shortest time possible. Easy access and rapid speeds allow developers to build, iterate and monetize in a flash.

### Layer-2 by Design

Autheo’s Layer-1 blockchain isn’t simply a means to an end – we built our protocol with Layer-2s in mind. Our support for Optimistic, SK and Loopring rollups can get your Layer-2 up, running and integrated in no time flat. Whether you are building a creator brand or a developer looking to expand their offerings, Autheo ensures you have what you need to succeed.

## Strong Network Effects

### A Constantly Growing Ecosystem

Each creator, developer or user that joins the Autheo ecosystem increases the value proposition of the network exponentially. Creators bring their audience into the SocialFi ecosystem, driving demand for additional features and applications. Developers meet these demands, further streamlining the user experience over time. Rather than fighting a platform’s algorithm or puzzling through obtuse third-party features, Autheo users will find everything they need from a sole source.

### Development Symbiosis 

Autheo’s drive to secure partnerships with major brands in the creator economy ensures a healthy supply of clients for developers that choose to build on the platform. Every new brand will need additional features and applications, while simultaneously growing both the creator and user base through their existing networks.

### Sustainable and Sensible

Leveraging the advantages of blockchain technology, Autheo provides the ability to monetize directly for both creators and developers. As the ecosystem grows, the token supply remains the same – incentivizing early adoption by developers looking to get in on the ground floor of Autheo applications.

## Why Choose Autheo?
