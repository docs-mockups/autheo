# Account Creation

New users can access the onboarding process by clicking **Sign Up** in the upper right corner of [the main Autheo site](https://www.autheo.com/).

This will bring you to the initial *Sign Up* window, where you can choose one of three registration options:

1. [Manual Sign Up](#manual-sign-up): Create an account manually through the Autheo form.

2. [Sign Up with Google](#sign-up-with-google): Sign up for Autheo by associating your Google account.

3. [Sign Up with Wallet](#sign-up-with-wallet): Create a new account based on an existing wallet.

## Manual Sign Up

When singing up manually, you will need to enter your *Full Name*, your desired *Username*, an *Email address* where Autheo can send account notifications and a strong *Password*.

:::note

We recommend using a password that is at least 12 characters long, comprised of letters, numbers and special characters.

:::

After entering this information, click **Sign Up** to bring up the *Verification Code* window. You should receive your verification code in the email address used for registration. If you cannot find the email and have checked your email's Spam folder, there is an option to *Resend* the code. 

Verifying your account will bring you to the next screen, where we will begin building your home feed. After filling in how you *Identify*, you will be brought to the *Select Niche and Topics* window.

Here, you can choose a *Niche* you are interested in. The dropdown menu allows you to choose a specific niche, or show all available *topics*. You may choose multiple topics within a single niche. If you want to add an additional niche, click the plus sign to the right of your existing niche to bring up another *Select Niche* instance. Once you are satisfied with your selections, click *Next*.

The *Create Community* window gives you the opportunity to create your own community on Autheo. You can find more information on creating a community here. If you do not want to create a community, click *Skip* to move to the next window.

The final page allows you to link various social media accounts to your Autheo account. Autheo natively supports linking [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/), [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/). You can divide these socials by sector if you are involved in more than one niche. Sectors can be added by clicking the green plus sign to the right of your existing *Select Sector* instance.

After inputting your social media links, click *Next* to complete account creation.

## Sign Up with Google

Clicking on **Sign Up with Google* will open a window where you can choose to *Create a new wallet* or *Import an existing wallet*. Clicking *Create a new wallet* will open a window where you can choose to either *Use a Recovery Phrase* or *Sign-up with Google*

Signing up with Google will bring you to the *Set Up Your Wallet* window. You will need to choose a *Wallet Name* and a strong *Password*. Make sure that you use a name that makes sense to you for easy identification. After entering this information and clicking *Sign Up*, you will be brought to a window that displays your *Private Key*. You will need your private key to recover your account if you lose access.

:::warning

We suggest writing your private key down and physically storing it in a safe space. It is not safe if stored digitally.

:::

After storing your private key, click *Got it* to move to the *Select Chains* window. Here, you can choose which blockchains you want to associate you wallet with initially. You can add or remove chains in the future using the *Manage Chain Visibility* option in the sidebar. Clicking *Save* will complete the account creation process.

## Sign Up with Wallet

Choosing *Sign up with Wallet* will give you the option to either *Create a new wallet* or *Import an existing wallet*.

### Creating a New Wallet

If you choose *Create a new wallet*, you will be brought to a new window where you can choose to either *Create a new recovery phrase* or *Import an existing recovery phrase*.

* Choosing *Create a new recovery phrase* will prompt you to generate your own 12-word recovery phrase and an associated wallet name. After entering this information, you will be prompted to also create a strong *password* for accessing the wallet through Autheo.

    Finally, you can *Select the Chains* you will be using the wallet with and then *Save* to finish creating your account.

* Choosing *Import an existing recovery phrase* allows you to use the recovery phrase of an existing wallet to create an Autheo wallet. You will be prompted to *name* the wallet and assign a strong *password* before selecting associated blockchains for the wallet.

    Clicking *Save* will complete account creation.

### Importing an Existing Wallet

Choosing *Import an existing wallet* will bring you to the *Network* window, where you can choose the blockchain your wallet is associated with. You can import your existing wallet with a **Recovery Phrase** or a **Private Key**.

Entering your recovery phrase or private key, in the appropriate tab, will give you the option to add a *Name* to the wallet. After clicking *Import* your account will be created using the existing wallet.
