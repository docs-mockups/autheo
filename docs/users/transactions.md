# Sending a Transaction with Autheo on CLI

You can send and receive transactions on the Autheo blockchain using any supported wallets, including [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/). However, you may also use a command-line interface (CLI) client to send transactions directly.

The `authd` CLI client follows most syntax available in the [`simapp`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/simapp) CLI client for Cosmos SDK.
